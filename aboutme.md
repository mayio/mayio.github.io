Hello there! 

I'm Mario, a software engineer working on Object Tracking — the core intelligence behind autonomous driving — in Hamburg, Germany.

I created this space to explore the algorithms and concepts that define my field. I'm keen to fill the knowledge gaps I've encountered myself and provide truly in-depth explanations. Feel free to explore both this blog and my GitHub repository for practical examples.

## My Focus: From Point Cloud to Real-Time Kinematics

Accurate environmental sensing is non-negotiable for advanced driver-assistance and autonomous systems. While vehicles rely on multiple sensors, my work concentrates on processing data from laser scanners (LiDAR), which generate massive point clouds.

My challenge is developing algorithms to extract objects — such as cars, trucks, pedestrians, and small obstacles — from this data in real-time. This involves precisely estimating their pose, shape, and kinematics to enable safe autonomous navigation.

My core expertise includes:

* Multiple Extended Target Tracking (METT)
* Shape Estimation
* Clustering
