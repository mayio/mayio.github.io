Hi! I am Mario, a software engineer working in the field of object tracking for autonomous driving in Hamburg, Germany. The goal is to estimate the pose and kinematics of objects - including the the smallest - in the vicinity of a car in real time. This is done by processing point clouds coming from multiple solid state Lidar scanners.

I am experienced in the fields of 
* Multiple Extended Target Tracking
* Shape estimation
* Clustering

I am keen to learn and would like to share some knowledge here when I feel it is not sufficiently covered elsewhere. I hope this blog and my github repository is useful for someone else.
