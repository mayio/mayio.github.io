Hi! I am Mario, a software engineer working in the field of object tracking for autonomous driving in Hamburg, Germany. 

Cars can be equiped with laser scanners (short and long range) to get a detailed perception of their environment. Those sensors produce massive point clouds. My work is to extract objects, like cars, trucks, pedestrians, small obstacles from this data. It is about estimating their pose, shape and kinematics in real time, to enable autonomous driving.

In the past years I got experienced in the fields of 
* Multiple Extended Target Tracking
* Shape estimation
* Clustering

This blog is about basic algorithms and concepts that I use. I am keen to learn and would like to share some knowledge here when I feel it is not sufficiently covered elsewhere. I hope this blog and my github repository is useful for someone else.
